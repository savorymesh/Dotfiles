# Dotfiles

Just my personal config files. Nonstandard ones are :

- config.cson: this is my Atom configuration file. Usually located at
  ~/.atom/config.cson.
- atom_packages.txt: a list of my installed Atom packages. To obtain, run
   
  ```$ apm list --installed --bare > atom_packages.txt```

  and to restore, run

  ```$ apm install -packages-files atom_packages.txt```
